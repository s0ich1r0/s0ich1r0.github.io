                        I like to program, I have been working on this for a long time on a local web server. Afraid to put it on as i did not feel it was good enough.

                    </p>
                    <p>I used <b style="color: var(--gold-bright);">FreeCodeCamp</b> to learn how to make websites, its free, and really gets you going in the right direction, even got the Certification again just to put on here haha</p>
                    <p>
