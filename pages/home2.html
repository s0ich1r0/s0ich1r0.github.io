                    <li>"Coding", Programming, Computer stuff, whatever you would like to call it. I ENJOY making GUIS, CLIs, and Websites a lot. I Love a lot of things about a computer and what one can do.</li>
                    <li>I <b style="color: var(--gold-bright);">Love</b> Music. I really ENJOY making music, I do it a lot, I make really stupid things sometimes. Sometimes they sound good to me.
                    <li>I have played <b style="color: var(--gold-bright);">Old School Runescape</b> since before it was old school and that was just runescape. I was very young, I do not play it a lot, I do however play it enough and believe it to be one of the greatest games ever made. Old School cares about their players.</li>
                    <li>I use<b style="color: var(--gold-bright);"> ARCH</b> btw :P</li>
